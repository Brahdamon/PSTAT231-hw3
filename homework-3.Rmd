## Classification

For this assignment, we will be working with part of a [Kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) that was the subject of a machine learning competition and is often used for practicing ML models. The goal is classification; specifically, to predict which passengers would survive the [Titanic shipwreck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic).

Load the data from `data/titanic.csv` into *R* and familiarize yourself with the variables it contains using the codebook (`data/titanic_codebook.txt`).

Notice that `survived` and `pclass` should be changed to factors. When changing `survived` to a factor, you may want to reorder the factor so that *"Yes"* is the first level.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(rlang)
library(corrr)
library(klaR)
library(discrim)
library(poissonreg)

#library(ISLR) # For the Smarket data set
#library(ISLR2) # For the Bikeshare data set
tidymodels_prefer()

set.seed(22)

# Load Data
rawData <- read.csv("data/titanic.csv")
head(rawData)

# Copy dataframe
data <- duplicate(rawData, shallow = FALSE)

#reorder factors
data$survived <- factor(data$survived, levels = c("Yes", "No"))
data$pclass <- factor(data$pclass)

levels(data$survived)
levels(data$pclass)
```

### Question 1

Split the data, stratifying on the outcome variable, `survived.`  You should choose the proportions to split the data into. Verify that the training and testing data sets have the appropriate number of observations. Take a look at the training data and note any potential issues, such as missing data.


```{r}
# Split the data for training/testing
dataSplit <- data %>% 
  initial_split(prop = 0.8,
                strata = survived)

dataTrain <- training(dataSplit)
dataTest <- testing(dataSplit)

#Check dimensions
dim(dataTest)
dim(dataTrain)

head(data)

# Return number of survived and did not
count(data, survived)

#look at the training data, check for missing values
na_count <-sapply(data, function(y) sum(is.na(y)))  
na_count
```
Why is it a good idea to use stratified sampling for this data?

We want to use stratified sampling for this data because there is an uneven proportion of passengers who survived and who died. Thus we want the models we train to train on the correct proportion of survivors and non-survivors relative to the total dataset.


### Question 2

Using the **training** data set, explore/describe the distribution of the outcome variable `survived`.

```{r}
counts <- data.frame(count(dataTrain, survived))
counts

sum(counts$n)

counts %>% mutate(percentage = n/sum(n))

data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = survived)) +
  geom_bar()
```


Out of 712 recorded passengers on the Titanic, 439 or 61.6% did not survive, while 273 (38.3%) did survive.


### Question 3

Using the **training** data set, create a correlation matrix of all continuous variables. Create a visualization of the matrix, and describe any patterns you see. Are any predictors correlated with each other? Which ones, and in which direction?

*We see the pairs (age, sib_sp) and (age, parch) slightly negatively correlated, and (sib_sp, parch), (fare, sib_sp), and (fare,,parch) slightly positively correlated.*

```{r}
names(dataTrain)

cor_data <- data %>%
  select(-c(survived, pclass, name, sex, ticket, cabin, embarked)) %>%
  correlate()

rplot(cor_data)
```


### Question 4

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable `survived`. Include the following predictors: ticket class, sex, age, number of siblings or spouses aboard, number of parents or children aboard, and passenger fare.

Recall that there were missing values for `age`. To deal with this, add an imputation step using `step_impute_linear()`. Next, use `step_dummy()` to **dummy** encode categorical predictors. Finally, include interactions between:

-   Sex and passenger fare, and
-   Age and passenger fare.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.

```{r}
names(dataTrain)

titanicRecipe <- recipe(survived ~ pclass + 
                           sex + 
                           age + 
                           sib_sp +  
                           parch +
                           fare, data = dataTrain) %>%
    step_impute_linear(age) %>%
    step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
    step_interact(terms = ~ sex:fare) %>%
    step_interact(terms = ~ age:fare)
    

```

### Question 5

Specify a **logistic regression** model for classification using the `"glm"` engine. Then create a workflow. Add your model and the appropriate recipe. Finally, use `fit()` to apply your workflow to the **training** data.

***Hint: Make sure to store the results of `fit()`. You'll need them later on.***


```{r}
log_reg <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  set_mode("classification")


log_wkflow <- workflow() %>% 
  add_model(log_reg) %>%
  add_recipe(titanicRecipe)

log_fit <- fit(log_wkflow, dataTrain)
```


### Question 6

**Repeat Question 5**, but this time specify a linear discriminant analysis model for classification using the `"MASS"` engine.

```{r}
lda_mod <- discrim_linear() %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("MASS")

lda_wkflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(lda_mod) %>%
  add_recipe(titanicRecipe)

lda_fit <- fit(lda_wkflow, dataTrain)
```

### Question 7

**Repeat Question 5**, but this time specify a quadratic discriminant analysis model for classification using the `"MASS"` engine.

```{r}
qda_mod <- discrim_quad() %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("MASS")

qda_wkflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(qda_mod) %>%
  add_recipe(titanicRecipe)

qda_fit <- fit(qda_wkflow, dataTrain)
```

### Question 8

**Repeat Question 5**, but this time specify a naive Bayes model for classification using the `"klaR"` engine. Set the `usekernel` argument to `FALSE`.

```{r warning = FALSE}
nb_mod <- naive_Bayes() %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  set_engine("klaR") %>%
  set_args(usekernel = FALSE)

nb_wkflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(nb_mod) %>%
  add_recipe(titanicRecipe)

nb_fit <- fit(nb_wkflow, dataTrain)
nb_fit
```


### Question 9

Now you've fit four different models to your training data.

Use `predict()` and `bind_cols()` to generate predictions using each of these 4 models and your **training** data. Then use the *accuracy* metric to assess the performance of each of the four models.

*Used augment() instead of bind_cols()*

Which model achieved the highest accuracy on the training data?

*The logistic regression achieved the highest accuracy on the training data, with an accuracy of 80.6%. It was closely followed by the quadratic discriminant analysis model which had an accuracy of 80.4%.*

```{r}
predict(log_fit, new_data = dataTrain, type = "prob")
predict(lda_fit, new_data = dataTrain, type = "prob")
predict(qda_fit, new_data = dataTrain, type = "prob")
predict(nb_fit, new_data = dataTrain, type = "prob")



# assess accuracy of logistic regression model
augment(log_fit, new_data = dataTrain) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)

log_acc <- augment(log_fit, new_data = dataTrain) %>%
  accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)

log_acc


# assess accuracy of lda model
augment(lda_fit, new_data = dataTrain) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)

lda_acc <- augment(lda_fit, new_data = dataTrain) %>%
  accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)

lda_acc


# assess accuracy of qda model
augment(qda_fit, new_data = dataTrain) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)

qda_acc <- augment(qda_fit, new_data = dataTrain) %>%
  accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)

qda_acc


# assess accuracy of naive bayes model
augment(nb_fit, new_data = dataTrain) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)

nb_acc <- augment(nb_fit, new_data = dataTrain) %>%
  accuracy(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)

nb_acc


```

### Question 10

Fit the model with the highest training accuracy to the **testing** data. Report the accuracy of the model on the **testing** data.

The model predicts the survival of persons on the titanic in the testing dataset with an accuracy of 84.9%.

```{r}

multiMetric <- metric_set(accuracy, sensitivity, specificity)

augment(log_fit, new_data = dataTest) %>%
  multiMetric(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)
```

Again using the **testing** data, create a confusion matrix and visualize it. Plot an ROC curve and calculate the area under it (AUC).

```{r}
augment(log_fit, new_data = dataTest) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = survived, estimate = .pred_class)


augment(log_fit, new_data = dataTest) %>%
  roc_curve(survived, .pred_Yes) %>%
  autoplot


augment(log_fit, new_data = dataTest) %>%
  roc_auc(survived, .pred_Yes)

```

How did the model perform? Compare its training and testing accuracies. If the values differ, why do you think this is so?


*The model performed pretty well. Its training accuracy was 80.6%, and its testing accuracy was 84.9%. This is counterintuitive, because I would believe that the model would be more likely to better describe the training data. The difference may be due to random chance, or perhaps passengers in the test data set were more clear-cut as likely to be survivors than those in the training set.



### Required for 231 Students

In a binary classification problem, let $p$ represent the probability of class label $1$, which implies that $1 - p$ represents the probability of class label $0$. The *logistic function* (also called the "inverse logit") is the cumulative distribution function of the logistic distribution, which maps a real number *z* to the open interval $(0, 1)$.

### Question 11

Given that:

$$
p(z)=\frac{e^z}{1+e^z}
$$

Prove that the inverse of a logistic function is indeed the *logit* function:

$$
z(p)=ln\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)
$$

### Question 12

Assume that $z = \beta_0 + \beta_{1}x_{1}$ and $p = logistic(z)$. How do the odds of the outcome change if you increase $x_{1}$ by two? Demonstrate this.

Assume now that $\beta_1$ is negative. What value does $p$ approach as $x_{1}$ approaches $\infty$? What value does $p$ approach as $x_{1}$ approaches $-\infty$?
